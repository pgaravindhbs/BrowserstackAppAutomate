# BrowserStack Reporting
# ======================
# The following capabilities are used to set up reporting on BrowserStack:
# Set 'projectName' to the name of your project. Example, Marketing Website
projectName: BrowserStack PGA Appium IOS
# Set `buildName` as the name of the job / testsuite being run
buildName: browserstack Appium Build IOS
# `buildIdentifier` is a unique id to differentiate every execution that gets appended to
# buildName. Choose your buildIdentifier format from the available expressions:
# ${BUILD_NUMBER} (Default): Generates an incremental counter with every execution
# ${DATE_TIME}: Generates a Timestamp with every execution. Eg. 05-Nov-19:30
# Read more about buildIdentifiers here -> https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/organize-tests
buildIdentifier: '#${BUILD_NUMBER}' # Supports strings along with either/both ${expression}
# Set `framework` of your test suite. Example, `testng`, `cucumber`, `cucumber-testng`
# This property is needed to send test context to BrowserStack (test name, status)
framework: testng
